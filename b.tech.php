					Cluster Innovation Centre, University of Delhi offers a four year B.Tech. Programme in Information Technology & Mathematical Innovations. This unique course, the first one to be offered at Cluster Innovation Centre, is designed to inculcate an innovation mindset as part of the curriculum and pedagogy. Building strong analytical skills through Mathematics and application skills of Information Technology (IT), this course encourages students to recognize the connectedness of various disciplines. Using IT as a vehicle for connecting mathematics with other disciplines, students are encouraged to develop innovative products and processes as part of curriculum. The course aims to produce adequately skilled graduates with a creative mindset who can provide new solutions to industry in particular and to society in general. It is hoped that some of these innovators will be entrepreneurs, who will be job providers rather than job seekers. The course is specifically designed to boost undergraduate research.
				</p>
				<blockquote class="text-justify">
                     The course offers three specialization streams – Management, Electronics & Embedded System and Systems Biology – important fields of education with significant interface with Mathematics and IT currently.
                </blockquote>
                <p class="text-justify">
                	The mode of learning shall be a healthy and productive blend of the formal and the inquiry based, with special focus on “hands on” and “project based” mode of learning. Learning shall happen to a large extent through teacher mentoring and peer learning that encourages creativity and relies on innovations.

                    Upon graduation, these students would have acquired innovation based creativity and would have matured in their thinking. They will have enhanced their communication and leadership abilities, and will have understood the deep and abiding connections between knowledge and its uses - between understanding the needs of society and the relevance of knowledge and the importance of societal obligations. Experiments, hands-on projects, innovative projects, model implementations linked to the curriculum will be carried out in the “Engineering Kitchen: Innovation Lab”. Assessment, at each stage, is designed in a manner to incentivize innovation by encouraging students to carry out new creative application of the theoretical knowledge acquired, either through a project, or through a laboratory activity/prototype in the engineering kitchen.
