            <p>Cluster Innovation Centre (CIC) was established in the year 2011, with the aim of fostering innovation and connecting entrepreneurship with classroom curriculum. Since then, the Centre has come a long way engendering self-reliance while engaging with real world problems. A number of students' start-ups incubated under the Centre's aegis are now having high valuation in the competitive market. It not only set exemplary standards for young business models but also have created several jobs. The students of the Centre have received coveted awards in different areas of innovation. The Centre offers degrees in B.A.(Honours) in Humanities and Social Sciences, B.Tech (Information Technology and Mathematical Innovations) and M.Sc. (Mathematics Education). The Centre has a mix of expertise with a number of distinguished faculties and attracts students from across the country.

We must join hands to generate new knowledge and solve the problems relevant to our society.

On behalf of CIC, I invite new and novel ideas which can be nurtured and incubated at the Centre.
